# ARFID Support Features - Development Plan

## üéØ **Overview**
Extending RecipeScaler with comprehensive ARFID support features to help families track food acceptance, meal patterns, and behavioral challenges.

## üìã **New Features**

### 1. **Safe Foods Management**
**Purpose**: Digital replacement for physical notebooks tracking accepted foods

#### Core Features:
- **Safe Foods List**: Create/edit list of foods the child accepts
- **Date Tracking**: Record when each food was first accepted (important milestone)
- **Food Categories**: Organize by type (proteins, carbs, fruits, etc.)
- **Notes**: Texture, preparation method, brand preferences
- **Photos**: Visual reference for specific presentations

#### User Stories:
- "As a parent, I want to add a new safe food with the date it was first accepted"
- "As a parent, I want to see the history of when foods were added to build confidence"
- "As a parent, I want to categorize foods to identify gaps in nutrition"

### 2. **Meal Logging**
**Purpose**: Track what and how much the child actually eats

#### Core Features:
- **Quick Meal Entry**: Select from safe foods list
- **Portion Tracking**: Amount eaten (visual portions: all, half, few bites, none)
- **Meal Context**: Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack
- **Mood/Energy**: Pre and post-meal energy levels
- **Location**: Home, school, restaurant, etc.
- **Success Factors**: What helped (music, TV, company, etc.)

#### User Stories:
- "As a parent, I want to quickly log what my child ate at lunch"
- "As a parent, I want to see patterns of when my child eats best"
- "As a parent, I want to track if new foods are being accepted"

### 3. **Lockdown Logging**
**Purpose**: Track challenging episodes to identify patterns and solutions

#### Core Features:
- **Incident Recording**: Date, time, duration of episode
- **Triggers**: What preceded the lockdown (hunger, transitions, sensory)
- **Behaviors**: Description of what happened
- **Resolution**: What helped end the episode
- **Energy Level**: Child's energy before/after
- **Family Impact**: How it affected the whole family
- **Success Strategies**: What worked for next time

#### User Stories:
- "As a parent, I want to log a difficult mealtime to understand triggers"
- "As a parent, I want to see if lockdowns correlate with low energy/hunger"
- "As a parent, I want to identify successful resolution strategies"
