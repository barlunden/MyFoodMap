# 🎮 Gamification for ARFID - Design Ideas

*MyFoodMap gamification concepts for motivating food exploration in families with ARFID and selective eating*

---

## Core Philosophy
Gamification for ARFID must be **supportive, not pressuring**. The goal is to reduce anxiety around food exploration and create positive associations with trying new things, while respecting individual pace and comfort levels.

## 🏆 XP & Level System

### Explorer Levels
- **Level 1: Food Curious** (0-100 XP)
- **Level 2: Taste Detective** (100-300 XP)
- **Level 3: Texture Explorer** (300-600 XP)
- **Level 4: Flavor Adventurer** (600-1000 XP)
- **Level 5: Nutrition Navigator** (1000-1500 XP)
- **Level 6: Food Master** (1500+ XP)

### XP Point System
| Action | XP Reward | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Register a safe food | 10 XP | Building foundation |
| Smell something new | 25 XP | Sensory exploration without pressure |
| Touch/feel new texture | 30 XP | Tactile exploration |
| Lick or tiny taste | 50 XP | Minimal commitment exploration |
| Take a small bite | 75 XP | Actual tasting |
| Complete a full meal | 30 XP | Routine success |
| Try same new food 3 times | 100 XP | **Repetition bonus - crucial for ARFID** |
| Try same new food 7 times | 200 XP | **Acceptance building** |
| Add detailed texture notes | 15 XP | Self-awareness building |
| Log energy level after meal | 10 XP | Body awareness |
