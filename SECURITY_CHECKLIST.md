# Security Implementation Checklist - MyFoodMap

## âœ… Completed Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] JWT authentication with strong secrets
- [x] All sensitive endpoints require authentication
- [x] User isolation - no shared data between users
- [x] Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] No fallback authentication secrets

### Data Protection
- [x] PostgreSQL database with user-level isolation
- [x] HTTPS encryption for all API communication
- [x] Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- [x] No hardcoded user IDs or demo accounts in production endpoints

### Privacy by Design
- [x] User data completely isolated per account
- [x] No analytics or tracking cookies
- [x] Privacy-first architecture
- [x] Open-source codebase for transparency

## ðŸ”„ In Progress

### API Security Hardening
- [ ] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (using Prisma ORM)
- [ ] XSS protection headers

### Advanced Authentication
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Session management and token refresh
- [ ] Password strength requirements

## ðŸ“‹ Next Priority Items

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Database backup encryption
- [ ] Log sanitization (remove sensitive data)
- [ ] Error message sanitization
- [ ] CORS configuration review

### Compliance Features
- [ ] Data export functionality
- [ ] Account deletion with data purging
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] Privacy policy acceptance tracking

### ARFID-Specific Security
- [ ] Healthcare provider integration (with consent)
- [ ] Family account management with proper access controls
- [ ] Minor protection features (COPPA compliance)
- [ ] Data sharing controls for caregivers

## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Notes

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Restart backend server** to load secure endpoints
2. **Update frontend** to use authenticated endpoints
3. **Test authentication flow** end-to-end
4. **Verify user data isolation** in production

### Production Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Change JWT_SECRET to cryptographically secure random value
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only in production
- [ ] Set secure cookie flags
- [ ] Configure CORS for production domains only
- [ ] Enable database connection encryption
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for security events

### Emergency Procedures
- **Data Breach Response**: Immediate user notification and password reset
- **Security Incident**: Log review and system isolation procedures
- **Privacy Violation**: Data audit and compliance notification

**Security is not a one-time implementation but an ongoing commitment.**  
**Regular security reviews and updates are essential for ARFID health data protection.**
